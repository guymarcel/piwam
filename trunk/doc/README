	2) How To Set Up Piwam
	---------------------

		For those who got this release through SVN repository :
			1- For those who are using Piwam thanks to SVN repository :
			`  Fix config/ProjectConfiguration.class. Include the correct
			   location of your sfCoreAutoload class
			   /!\ If you got a packaged tarball, you don't need to do that.
			2- Edit apps/front/config/settings.yml with your own settings
			3- Edit config/databases.yml settings to be able to access to
			   your own DB
			4- Launch SQL file `doc/piwam-install.sql` 
			5- Create a `cache` folder which is writable
			
		You are currently pleased to use only `dev` environment, otherwise
		you have to set up another one (`prod` ?) by yourself.

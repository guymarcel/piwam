* How To Set Up Piwam
---------------------

For those who got this release through SVN repository :
	1- Fix config/ProjectConfiguration.class. Include the correct location
	   of your sfCoreAutoload class
	2- Edit apps/front/config/settings.yml with your own settings
	3- Edit config/databases.yml settings to be able to access to your own DB
	4- Launch SQL file `doc/piwam-install.sql` 
	5- Create a `cache` folder which can is writable
	
You are currently pleased to use only `dev` environment, otherwise you have to set up
another one (`prod` ?) by yourself.
